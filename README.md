# FifaVsReality
The poster is the result of a project realized as part of the Data Visualization Techniques course. The topic of the project was sport and this poster theme is FIFA vs Reality. We tried to answer the question whether FIFA faithfully reflects reality. Design was created in Canva and visualizations in R.
